Introduction
This guide is a collection of resources on healthy diets to help adults adopt
healthier, evidence-based diets patterns. Parts of multiple researched patterns
(D.A.S.H., Mediterranean, Low-fat, Paleo, etc.) are included, which allows you
to select a variety of beneficial foods that meet your dietary needs.


This guide was made to be general and applies to adults of all genders, sexes,
muscle masses, activity levels, energy needs, etc. Ask your doctor if you have
other questions regarding your specific diet.

    You can substitute them for cow’s milk if you tolerate them
    better.
•   Soy milk and soy-alternatives to dairy usually have added
    vitamins and minerals to provide similar nutritional content
    found in standard dairy. You can have plant alternatives
    (almond, cashew, coconut, etc.), but they can’t be substituted
    for dairy or fortified-soy options.

Section 2: What to know about other food groups
Whole vs. refined grains
•   Make half (or more) of your grains whole grains
•   Typical whole grains are identified by being able to see the entire grain:




•   Products containing significant amounts of whole grains are labeled with a
    stamp to help consumers achieve their minimum servings (2.5-3.5) of whole
    grains/day:




1 full serving of whole grains        1 half serving of whole grains (8g whole
(100% stamp)                          grains stamp or basic WG product)


•   The amount of fiber in whole grains varies. The
    amount of fiber on the nutrition label cannot be
    used as an indicator of a whole grain. Generally, a
    serving of whole grains will not exceed 4 grams of
    fiber:
• The nutrition label shows whole grain bread with
    less than 4 grams of fiber per slice).


There are a range of different grains:
    •   Whole-food whole grains

    •   Products containing significant amounts of whole grain ingredients
    •   Refined grains
    •   Products containing refined grains




Potatoes & corn
Potatoes and corn are typically defined as vegetables because of their high
starch content, but they are processed in the body more like grains than other
common vegetables. You can include potatoes and corn in your diet alongside
other nutrient-dense whole grains.




•   Serving size:                            •       Serving size:
•   1 medium potato (boiled/baked)           •       1 large ear
•   1 cup fresh, diced, mashed, or           •       1 cup of kernels, fresh or frozen
    frozen


Added sugars
Added sugars are called by many different names, including:
•   Brown/white sugar Cane sugar                 •    Molasses
•   Beet sugar Corn syrups Caramel               •    Treacle
•   "Syrups" or other "sugars"                   •    Honey
•   Glucose or dextrose Lactose                  •    Agave
•   Dextrin or maltodextrin                      •    Maple syrup
•   Glucose syrup solids                         •    Turbinado
•   Sucanat                                      •    Cane syrup

                                         -6-
Many foods contain hidden sugars, and even packaged whole-food products can
have added sugar, including: coffees, teas, fruit juices, yogurts, packaged fruits,
salad dressings, sauces, condiments, and sports drinks.




Other food that are often high in added sugars include:
•   Fast food items (buns, wraps, etc.)
•   Sauces (marinara, barbecue, etc.)
•   Breakfast cereals
•   Deli meats (honey or sugar cured)
•   Juice concentrates (orange, grape, apple, etc.)
•   Soft drinks


Products will vary in their added sugar content,
but they can always be identified on the nutrition
facts label. The amount of added sugar in a
product can be found under "Total
Carbohydrates" as "Added Sugars".


Limit your intake of added sugar to 6 teaspoons
(or less) of added sugar per day.


Fats and oils
Use minimal fats and oils for cooking and in dressings
•   For cooking, aim for 1 teaspoon of added fat or oil per person per meal
•   Some fats and oils can be extra sources of omega-3 fats for vegan or
    vegetarian diets

Dairy and soy alternatives
If you don’t eat dairy and soy, you can substitute plant products as long as they
are fortified. Check the ingredients of plant- based alternatives to see if they
are fortified in calcium, potassium, or Vitamins A, D, and B12. Other vitamins
and minerals are often included.


You can also use foods from other groups to make up for the nutrients found
in dairy and soy products. Increasing your intake of the following foods can
help meet your nutrient requirements:
•   Leafy green vegetables                      •   General fruits/vegetables
    o (Calcium, Vitamin A)                          o (Potassium, Magnesium)
•   Small fish bones                            •   Seafood
    o (Calcium)                                     o (Selenium, Phosphorous
•   Nuts and seeds                                      Vitamins B12 & D)
    o (Protein, Phosphorous, Zinc)              •   Eggs
•   Beans/peas/lentils                              o (Protein, Vitamin B12)
    o (Protein, Phosphorous, Zinc)              •   Nutritional yeast
•   Yellow/red/green vegetables                     o (B Vitamins)
    o (Vitamin A)


          *You can also get Vitamin D through exposure to sunlight. Exposing
          your arms and legs to 10-20 minutes daily can increase Vitamin D
          to optimal levels.


Sea vegetables
Sea vegetables are different types of edible seaweed. They are a potent source
of antioxidants and are low in calories, making them nutrient-dense. You can
eat sea vegetables fresh or dried. You can purchase them at health food stores
or online.


Different types of sea vegetables include:
    •   Kelp                                        •   Arame
