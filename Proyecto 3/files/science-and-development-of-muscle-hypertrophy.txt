     PREFACE
      This book truly has been a labor of love.
         I had envisioned writing an evidence-based text on muscle hypertrophy since my
      days as a graduate student in exercise science. At the time there were a plethora of
      consumer-oriented books describing programs for building muscle. However, they
      all relied largely on anecdote to make recommendations; none extensively delved
      into the actual science of the topic. A more scientific approach was clearly needed for
      the masses. In 2016, my vision became reality with publication of the first edition
      of Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy.
         Much has transpired since the release of the book’s first edition. For one, research
      on muscle hypertrophy has skyrocketed. Thousands of new studies have been pub-
      lished, helping to further our understanding as to what makes muscle grow and
      how to best go about optimizing muscle development. Moreover, feedback and the
      perspective of time have allowed me to see ways in which the original text could
      be improved and expanded. Ultimately, I determined that a revision of the original
      text was warranted.
         I am thrilled to present the second edition of Science and Development of Muscle
      Hypertrophy. The text has been completely updated, with inclusion of more than
      30% new content. In addition to containing extensive discussion of new research
      findings and their practical implications to muscle building, I have added two new
      chapters of importance: one that delves into the methods employed to measure
      muscle growth and another that evaluates various advanced training practices
      commonly employed to enhance hypertrophy. Further, 10 new sidebars highlight
      specific topics of interest to gaining lean mass.
         A few words of note about the book in general: While the writing is geared toward
      master’s level students in exercise-related disciplines, the majority of the text should
      be accessible to anyone with a fundamental understanding of the principles of
      exercise science. The first two chapters are the most scientifically technical, and will
      require some background in exercise physiology and biomechanics to fully appre-
      ciate the complexities and challenges faced when attempting to draw inferences as
      to the underlying mechanisms of what drives hypertrophic adaptations. However,
      even if you do not possess a strong scientific background, much information can
      be gleaned from at least reading through these chapters to familiarize yourself with
      basic concepts and terminology.
         Despite its scientific basis, the overall focus of the book is on the applied aspects
      of muscle development. As such, each chapter contains “key points” that summarize
      take-home messages and their practical applications. There also is an entire chapter
      (chapter 8) devoted to synthesizing the literature in an evidence-based fashion to
      create customized hypertrophy-oriented programs.
         In sum, I hope you agree this is the most complete resource on the market for
      bridging the gap between science and practice to optimize muscle development.
         Knowledge is power; learn and thrive.

    Type II fibers, also known as fast-
    twitch fibers, serve as a counterpart to
    Type I fibers. They can reach peak ten-
    sion in less than half the time—just
    50 ms—thereby making them better
    suited for strength- or power-related
    endeavors. However, they fatigue
    quickly and thus have limited capac-

    high levels of muscular endurance.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)   Primary hypertrophic effects of the systemic isoform appear to be in stimulating

Growth hormone (GH)                    Anabolic effects of GH on muscle tissue are carried out primarily via its poten-

                                       anabolism independent of IGF-1, it remains questionable whether these effects
                                       have an appreciable impact on postnatal muscle development.
Testosterone                           Directly increases myofibrillar protein synthesis and decreases proteolysis.

                           the most studied of the ILs, appears to carry out hypertrophic actions by inducing satellite cell
                           proliferation and influencing satellite cell–mediated myonuclear accretion. Emerging research
                           indicates that IL-15 may be important to exercise-induced anabolism, although evidence remains
                           somewhat preliminary. Other ILs also have been postulated to play a role in hypertrophy, including
                           IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-10, although evidence on their exercise-induced effects remains equivocal.

                                            TAKE-HOME POINTS

               •   Early-phase adaptations to resistance training are primarily related to neural
                   improvements including greater recruitment, rate coding, synchronization,
                   and doublet firing. The extent and temporal course of neural adaptations
                   depend on the degrees of freedom and complexity of the movement patterns.
               •   Muscular adaptations are predicated on net protein balance over time.
                   The process is mediated by intracellular anabolic and catabolic signaling
                   cascades.
               •   Hypertrophy can occur in series or in parallel, or both. The primary means
                   by which muscles increase in size following resistance training is through
                   parallel hypertrophy. Resistance training does promote changes in sarco-
                   plasmic fractions, but it is not clear whether these adaptations are practi-
                   cally meaningful from a hypertrophic standpoint, nor is it known whether
                   different training protocols elicit differential effects on the extent of these
                   changes. There is contradictory evidence as to whether hyperplasia occurs
                   as a result of traditional resistance training; if any fiber splitting does occur,
                   the overall impact on muscle size appears to be relatively minimal.
               •   Satellite cells appear to be crucial to maximizing the hypertrophic response
                   to resistance training. The primary role of satellite cells appears to be their
                   ability to retain a muscle’s mitotic capacity by donating nuclei to existing
                   myofibers. Satellite cells also are involved in the repair and remodeling of
                   muscle tissue, including the co-expression of myogenic regulatory factors
                   that mediate growth-related processes. Additional hypertrophic effects of
                   satellite cells may lie in their regulatory role in the remodeling of extracel-
                   lular matrix components.

                               Hypertrophy-Related Responses and Adaptations to Exercise Stress




•   The endocrine system is intricately involved in the regulation of muscle mass.
    The chronic production of testosterone, growth hormone, IGF-1, and other
    anabolic hormones influences protein balance to bring about changes in
    resistance training–mediated muscular adaptations. Although the manipu-
    lation of resistance training variables can acutely elevate systemic levels in
    the immediate post-workout period, it is not clear whether these transient
    hormonal spikes play a role in the hypertrophic response; if there are any
    such effects, they appear to be of relatively minor consequence and most
    likely permissive in nature.
•   Myokines are important players in exercise-induced muscular adaptations.
    These autocrine/paracrine agents exert their effects directly on muscle tissue
    as a result of mechanical stimulation. Numerous myokines have been iden-
    tified, although the specific roles of the substances and their interactions
    with one another have yet to be elucidated.

RESEARCH FINDINGS
  BLOOD FLOW RESTRICTION
  The impact of metabolic stress on hypertrophic adaptations is exemplified by blood
  flow restriction (BFR) training studies. BFR training involves restricting venous inflow
  via the use of a pressure cuff while training (figure 2.5) with light weights (generally
  equating to <40% of 1RM), thereby heightening ischemia in the muscle as it contracts.
     The prevailing body of literature shows that
  BFR training stimulates anabolic signaling and
  muscle protein synthesis (78) and markedly
  increases muscle growth (156) despite employ-
  ing loads often considered too low to promote
  significant hypertrophy (32, 140).
     It has been speculated that metabolic stress
  is the driving force behind BFR-induced muscle
  hypertrophy. Significant metabolite buildup has
  been noted during such training (154), pointing
  to an association between metabolic stress and
  muscle growth. In further support of this conten- FIGURE 2.5 A blood flow restriction imple-

  of the thigh muscle were found in college-aged
  males after 3 weeks of walking with BFR of the legs (3). Given that healthy young
  subjects generally do not gain muscle from performing low-intensity aerobic exercise,
  the study provides strong evidence that factors other than mechanical tension were
  responsible for hypertrophic adaptations. Indeed, increases in muscle cross-sectional
  area were found to be significantly correlated with the changes in inorganic phosphate
  (r = .876) and intramuscular pH (r = .601) during BFR training carried out at 20% of
  1RM. Results suggest that metabolic stress generated during exercise may be a
  key regulator of muscle growth (263). In further support of this hypothesis, evidence
  indicates that ischemia—a potent mediator of metabolic stress—upregulates anabolic
  myokines during exercise performance, although the duration of these elevations is
  rather transient, returning to baseline values within approximately 30 minutes after
  cessation of training (249).
     Studies investigating resistance training under conditions of hypoxia provide further
  evidence of an association between metabolic stress and muscle growth. Kon and
  colleagues (133) found that breathing 13% oxygen during a multiset, low-load (~50%
  of 1RM) protocol with fairly short interset rest intervals (~1 minute) significantly
  heightened blood lactate levels compared to the same routine performed under
  normoxic conditions, providing proof of principle that hypoxia heightens metabolite
  accumulation. Several studies show that hypoxia enhances the hypertrophic response
  to resistance training. Nishimura and colleagues (198) reported significantly greater
  increases in elbow flexor cross-sectional area when 4 sets of 10 repetitions at 70%
  of 1RM were performed under conditions of acute hypoxia versus normoxia. Similar
  findings have been reported elsewhere (19). Although these findings do not provide
  a causal link between hypertrophy and metabolic stress, they raise the possibility
  that increased metabolite accumulation plays a role in the process (247). It should be
  noted that reactive oxygen species (ROS) released during conditions of hypoxia have
  been implicated in carrying out a variety of signaling responses, providing another
                                                                              (continued)

               metabolic stress (19), possibly mediated by direct inducement of myogenesis via
               activation of HIF-1α (40). Moreover, not all studies have shown greater hypertrophy
               when training under hypoxic versus normoxic conditions (75), suggesting that dif-

  RESEARCH FINDINGS
      CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE HYPERTROPHIC ROLE OF
      METABOLIC STRESS
      Strong evidence suggests that exercise-induced metabolic stress contributes to the
      hypertrophic response. What remains to be determined is whether these effects are
      additive to the stimulus from mechanical forces or perhaps redundant provided a
      given loading threshold is achieved. The difficulty in trying to draw inferences from
      experimental resistance training designs is that mechanical tension and metabolic
      stress occur in tandem, confounding the ability to tease out the effects of one from
      the other. This can result in mistakenly attributing growth to metabolic factors when
      mechanical factors are, in fact, responsible, or vice versa.
          The ability to draw a cause–effect relationship between metabolic stress and
      hypertrophy is further confounded by the fact that the exercise-induced buildup of
      metabolites generally occurs in tandem with damage to myofibers. Given the com-
      monly held belief that damaging exercise mediates anabolism (241), it is difficult to
      distinguish the effects of one variable from the other with respect to hypertrophic
      adaptations. Research showing that blood flow restriction training increases muscle
      growth without significant damage to fibers suggests that the hypertrophic effects of
      metabolite accumulation are indeed separate from myodamage (157), although con-
      flicting evidence on the topic renders a definitive conclusion premature (299). Some
      evidence indicates that metabolic stress only contributes to muscle growth during
      performance of low-load resistance training, with no additive hypertrophic effects
      seen when training with heavy loads (80% of 1RM), at least at the whole-muscle
      level (18).
          Finally and importantly, the mechanisms responsible for anabolic effects of meta-
      bolic stress have not been fully elucidated. Although it is conceivable that increased
      muscle fiber recruitment is the primary mechanism by which metabolite accumulation
      induces hypertrophic adaptations, it seems unlikely that this phenomenon solely
      accounts for any or all of the observed effects. Rather, evidence suggests that the
      combined integration of multiple local and perhaps systemic factors contributes to
      muscular growth in a direct or permissive manner, or both (302). The fact that human
      studies to date have been primarily carried out in untrained subjects leaves open the
      prospect that mechanisms may differ based on training experience.

           RESEARCH FINDINGS
               CHALLENGES TO THE EIMD HYPOTHESIS
               As discussed, muscles become increasingly less susceptible to damage with recurring
               exercise—a function of the repeated bout effect. This phenomenon would seem to
               rule out potential involvement of EIMD in the hypertrophic response of those who are
               well trained (199). However, evidence suggests that myodamage is indeed present
               in trained lifters when performing unaccustomed exercise, albeit to a lesser extent
               than in novices. Gibala and colleagues (84) recruited six resistance-trained men to
               perform 8 sets of 8 repetitions at a load equivalent to 80% of 1RM. The researchers
               employed a unilateral protocol whereby one arm performed only concentric actions
               while the other arm performed only eccentric actions. Muscle biopsies taken 21
               hours after the exercise bout showed a significantly greater disruption in fibers from
               the eccentrically trained arms than in the concentrically trained arms. These findings
               underscore the fact that the repeated bout effect only attenuates the magnitude of
               muscle damage on a general level as opposed to preventing its occurrence when a
               novel routine is employed and leaves open the possibility that EIMD may contribute
               to hypertrophy in well-trained lifters. It seems that the key to this response is to
               provide a novel stimulus by altering training variables in an unaccustomed fashion.
                  Some researchers have questioned whether EIMD confers any anabolic effects,
               based on research showing marked hypertrophy from low-intensity BFR training with
               ostensibly minimal tissue damage (2, 265). The BFR technique combines light loads
               (20% to 50% of 1RM) with occlusion via pressure cuff to impede venous return
               without obstructing arterial inflow. Regular performance of BFR induces marked
               hypertrophy, often similar to what is observed with the use of heavy loads. Given the
               light loads employed, it is hypothesized that BFR confers these hypertrophic benefits
               while minimizing disruption of myofibers. However, muscle damage is a known con-
               sequence of reperfusion subsequent to ischemia (72, 99). Takarada and colleagues
               (265) demonstrated that although markers of muscle damage were attenuated after
               BFR training, there was evidence of fine microdamage within myofibers, leaving
               open the possibility that damage may have contributed to the results. Moreover, it
               remains possible that hypertrophy would have been enhanced to an even greater
               extent had EIMD been heightened in the BFR group. Markers of muscle damage
               following BFR have been demonstrated elsewhere, including lengthy decrements
               in maximal voluntary contraction, heightened delayed-onset muscle soreness, and
               elevated sarcolemmal permeability (64, 298, 299).
                  Some investigators have questioned whether EIMD mediates hypertrophic adapta-
               tions based on research showing that downhill running can induce significant damage
               to muscle tissue without corresponding growth (24). This observation, however, fails
               to take into account the unique molecular responses associated with aerobic versus
               resistance exercise, and the corresponding post-workout stimulation of myofibers.
               The two types of training activate and suppress distinctly different subsets of genes
               and cellular signaling pathways (109), thereby bringing about divergent muscular
               adaptations. It also should be noted that damage elicited by aerobic training manifests
               differently from that elicited by resistance exercise. Peak creatine kinase activity is
               noted approximately 12 to 24 hours after downhill running, whereas that associated
               with resistance training is not evident until about 48 hours after the training bout
               and can peak 4 to 6 days post-workout (246). In addition, downhill running is associ-
               ated with peak creatine kinase levels of between 100 to 600 IU, whereas those of

          resistance range from 2,000 to 10,000 IU (44). The implications of these variances
          remain to be established. Moreover, creatine kinase levels do not necessarily reflect
          the degree or time course of myodamage (45), calling into question their practical
          relevance with respect to exercise training. What can be inferred from aerobic training
          data is that muscle damage by itself is not sufficient to induce significant muscle
          growth. Thus, if EIMD does play a role in the hypertrophic response to exercise, it
          can do so only in the presence of resistance-based mechanical overload.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
 EFFECT OF NSAIDS ON MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a class of analgesics commonly
 used to relieve the pain and swelling associated with delayed-onset muscle soreness.
 NSAIDs are thought to promote pain-reducing effects by inhibiting the activity of
 cyclooxygenase (COX), a family of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic
 acid to pro-inflammatory prostanoids (30, 288). Thirty million people are estimated
 to take NSAIDS daily (15), and their use is especially widespread among those who
 participate in intense exercise programs (297).
    An often-overlooked issue with NSAID consumption in combination with resistance
 training, however, is the potential interference with muscular adaptations. In addition
 to the effects of NSAIDs on pain sensation, prostanoids also are purported to stim-
 ulate the upstream regulators of protein synthesis, including PI3K and extracellular
 signal-regulated kinases (79, 208, 228). Moreover, there is evidence that prostanoids
 are intricately involved in enhancing satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and
 fusion (21), thereby facilitating greater muscle protein accretion (115). These data
 provide compelling evidence that COX enzymes are important and perhaps even
 necessary for maximizing resistance training–induced muscle hypertrophy (256).
    Despite a seemingly logical basis for COX-mediated hypertrophic effects, acute
 studies on the use of NSAIDs do not seem to show a detrimental impact on post-exer-
 cise protein synthesis. Although NSAID administration in animal trials following chronic
 overload has consistently found impairments in protein metabolism (208, 228, 287),
 only one human trial showed a blunting of protein synthesis (280), whereas several
 others failed to note a deleterious effect (28, 185, 215). Discrepancies between find-
 ings may be related to methodological variances, physiological differences between
 species, or differences in the mechanisms of the NSAIDs used (i.e., selective versus
 nonselective COX inhibitors).
    On the other hand, the body of literature strongly suggests that NSAID use inter-
 feres with satellite cell function. This has been shown in vitro (180, 207) as well as
 in vivo in both animal (21, 23) and human trials (161, 184). It has been proposed that
 hypertrophy is limited by a myonuclear domain ceiling, estimated at approximately
 2,000 μm2; beyond this ceiling, additional nuclei must be derived from satellite cells
 for further increases in hypertrophy to occur (216). Although a rigid ceiling threshold
 has been challenged (192), the general consensus among researchers is that when
 fibers reach a certain critical size, satellite cell–derived nuclei are needed to promote
 additional gains. Therefore, a blunting of satellite cell function would seemingly limit
 a person’s hypertrophic potential by restricting the satellite cell pool.
    How the acute data play out over the long term is not clear. Results from studies
 that have directly investigated the effects of NSAIDs on hypertrophy are conflicting.
 Consistent with the research on protein synthesis, animal studies indicate that
 NSAID administration markedly reduces overload-induced muscle growth (23, 201,
 256). Alternatively, several human trials have either failed to demonstrate hyper-
 trophic impairments (142, 214) or showed a positive effect from NSAID use during
 regimented resistance training (281). When attempting to reconcile differences
 between studies, it is possible that NSAIDs reduce protein breakdown to a similar
 or even greater degree than they suppress protein synthesis, thus resulting in a
 non-negative protein balance. Rodent studies lend support to this hypothesis (228).
 The fact that the study showing increased hypertrophy from the use of NSAIDs (281)
                                                                               (continued)

     Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy




               Effect of NSAIDs on Muscle Hypertrophy (continued)

               was carried out in elderly adults (60 to 85 years of age) raises the possibility that
               positive benefits were due to a suppression of chronic inflammation, which has been
               shown to impair anabolism and accelerate proteolysis (225). It is also conceivable
               that the extent of hypertrophy in human trials was below the subjects’ myonuclear
               domain ceiling. This would seemingly explain why animal models using techniques
               designed to promote extreme rates of hypertrophy (i.e., synergist ablation, chronic
               stretch) far beyond that of traditional resistance training in humans show substantial
               hypertrophic impairment, because a robust satellite cell pool would be required for
               continued muscle growth.
                  Lilja and colleagues (153) conducted the most comprehensive human study to date
               on the topic in resistance-trained, young, healthy individuals. As opposed to previous
               work in young subjects (142), the study administered a higher dosage (1,200 mg/day
               vs. 400 mg/day of ibuprofen), and training was carried out over a longer study period
               (8 weeks vs. 6 weeks), thereby providing better insights into effects on muscular
               adaptations. Contrary to other findings, results showed that quadriceps growth in
               the NSAID group was blunted to approximately half that of the group receiving a
               placebo (3.7% vs. 7.5%, respectively). The researchers noted a downregulation of
               IL-6 in the NSAID group compared to the placebo group, providing a potential mech-
               anistic explanation for the impaired gains associated with ibuprofen consumption.
               In summary, evidence indicates that the occasional use of NSAIDs does not impair
               muscle hypertrophy. Whether chronic NSAID administration is detrimental to muscle
               growth remains undetermined and likely is population specific: those with chronic
               low-grade inflammation might benefit from their use, whereas healthy, well-trained
               people could see long-term impairments.

          PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
             CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE HYPERTROPHIC ROLE
             OF MUSCLE DAMAGE
             A sound theoretical rationale exists for how EIMD may contribute to the accre-
             tion of muscle proteins. Although exercise-induced hypertrophy can apparently
             occur without significant myodamage (304), evidence implies that microtrauma
             enhances the adaptive response or at least initiates the signaling pathways that
             mediate anabolism. That said, a cause–effect relationship between EIMD and
             hypertrophy has yet to be established, and if such a relationship does exist,
             the degree of damage necessary to maximize muscle growth remains to be
             determined. Research does suggest a threshold for a hypertrophic stimulus,
             beyond which additional myodamage confers no further benefits and may in fact
             interfere with growth-related processes. There is clear evidence that excessive
             EIMD reduces a muscle’s force-producing capacity. This in turn interferes with
             the ability to train at a high level, which impedes muscle development. More-
             over, although training in the early recovery phase of EIMD does not seem to
             exacerbate muscle damage, it may interfere with the recovery process (143,
             199). Taken as a whole, it can be speculated that a protocol that elicits a mild to
             moderate amount of damage may help to maximize the hypertrophic response.
             Considering that a ceiling effect slows the rate of hypertrophy as one gains
             training experience, EIMD may be particularly relevant to the anabolic response
             in well-trained people. These hypotheses require further study to ascertain their
             veracity.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
 BIOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT OF MUSCLE MASS: A
 VIABLE METHOD OF HYPERTROPHY MEASUREMENT?
 Several biochemical methods can be employed to estimate total body skeletal muscle
 mass. Although not as well-known as other methods of measurement, biochemical
 techniques can be viable options for morphological assessment. The most studied
 of these methods involves the measurement of 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion,
 which shows a good correlation with muscle mass in humans (44). The approach
 originated from animal research showing congruity between total body creatine
 and urinary excretion of creatinine. However, the validity of the method depends
 on the assumption that conversion of creatine to creatinine is constant among and
 within individuals. While this may have credence in a sedentary population, it does
 not necessarily hold true during resistance training, in which values can vary widely.
 Moreover, validity of the technique is predicated on accurate urine collection over
 the entire study period as well as stable maintenance of dietary protein intake, which
 can be challenging under free-living situations.
    A novel technique using deuterated creatine, referred to as the D3-creatine dilution
 method, has been proposed as a superior alternative to other biochemical approaches.
 D3-creatine is a stable isotope that is consumed orally in water and taken up almost
 exclusively by skeletal muscle, which represents the storage site of approximately
 95% of the body’s creatine stores (muscle has no capacity for creatine synthesis).
 The total-body creatine pool is then calculated from D3-creatinine enrichment in urine
 via liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; an estimate of muscle mass
 is obtained by dividing the creatine pool size using an estimation of creatine content
 in muscle.
    The D3-creatine dilution method was initially validated in rodents, showing a strong
 relationship with estimates of lean tissue mass (r = .96) (83). A follow-up study
 demonstrated the method could be employed repeatedly over time to accurately
 measure lean tissue changes in growing rats (84). Collectively, the findings show
 promise for D3-creatine dilution as an assessment tool.
    Subsequent pilot work in humans reported good agreement in muscle mass
 estimates between D3-creatine dilution and MRI (r = .87) (13). The method showed
 less bias than DXA-derived estimates, which overestimated muscle mass by approx-
 imately 2-fold compared to MRI. However, the study was carried out in a hospital
 setting with a 5-day period of continuous urine collection; hence, its applicability to
 free-living populations is extremely limited.
    In an attempt to enhance practicality, a study was undertaken to determine whether
 a urine sample obtained after an overnight fast would suffice to accurately predict
 muscle mass, both as a single measurement and for longitudinal assessment (14).
 Correlation analysis showed strong agreement between the D3-creatine dilution
 method and MRI-derived predictions of muscle mass (r = .88 to .91). However, the
 method underestimated muscle mass by 2.3 to 3.0 kg (5.1 to 6.6 lb) as well as pro-
 duced significantly greater intraindividual variability than MRI. Moreover, variances
 were greater in women than in men, calling into question its validity when assessing

              Biochemical Assessment of Muscle Mass: A Viable Method of Hypertrophy
              Measurement? (continued)

                  Overall, emerging evidence indicates that D3-creatine dilution is a potentially useful
               tool in determining muscle morphology. However, measurements are specific to the
               entire body; it is not possible to glean insights into regional muscular dimensions.
               In addition, and perhaps more important from a hypertrophy standpoint, validity of
               the method is dependent on a stable population, which precludes its use in exercise
               protocols. Therefore, its applicability seems to be limited to sedentary populations
               and may be most relevant for assessing sarcopenia.

Bioelectrical Impedance
Analysis
BIA emits a low-level electrical current through-
out the body and then estimates body com-
position based on the ease of electrical flow
through the body while taking into account
the individual’s height, weight, and sex. BIA
is perhaps the most convenient of all body
composition modalities, taking less than a few
minutes to complete. It also is relatively inex-
pensive and thus is employed extensively in
research settings. Higher-end BIA units are able
to estimate segmental lean mass and skeletal
muscle mass. A unique feature of certain BIA
units is an ability to calculate intracellular and
extracellular fluid compartments, which cannot
be gleaned from other techniques.

           RESEARCH FINDINGS
               DISCERNING BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP
               RESULTS
               As with results in all applied exercise-related studies, it is important to understand the
               difference in the implications of body composition research when studying a group
               versus an individual. Research findings generally are reported as the collective mean
               (i.e., average) of data obtained from a cohort of subjects. However, there will be a
               variance in responses across different subjects, the extent of which is exhibited as
               the standard deviation of the data. Sometimes these variances can be quite large.
               Hence, simply taking the mean at face value does not necessarily reflect the results
               a given person can expect to see.
                   In the case of body composition testing, a given method of assessment can
               produce a wide range of values in lean mass changes, both positive and negative,
               and end up showing no mean change. However, from a mean statistical standpoint,
               the findings can be virtually identical to another assessment tool showing a much
               narrower range of values that hover around the zero mark. These issues have been
               demonstrated in numerous validation studies for hypertrophy assessments. For
               example, ADP and hydrodensitometry were found to be interchangeable with the
               4C model for quantifying group changes in fat-free mass when using a diet-induced
               weight loss program; however, large differences were seen on an individual level,
               leading the authors to conclude: “as indicated by the wide limits of agreement . . .
               individual estimates of changes in body composition when taken alone should be
               interpreted with caution” (55). Similarly, a study that investigated agreement between
               4C, 3C, and 2C models found all three methods gave acceptable group mean values,
               but on an individual level, only the 3C model served as a valid alternative to 4C (89).
                   Group versus individual discrepancies also may apply to sources of error associated
               with a given assessment tool. For instance, alterations in food intake increased DXA
               estimates of total and regional lean soft-tissue mass up to 1.7% and 3%, respec-
               tively, on a group level; on an individual level these increases were >4.5% and 9%,
               respectively (88). From an individual standpoint, a person therefore potentially could
               expect to experience much larger variations in body composition measure from dietary
               alterations than that seen for the cohort as a whole.
                   The greatest interest in body composition assessment for most individuals gen-
               erally involves tracking lean mass changes over time. In this regard, it is relatively
               unimportant (within reason) whether a given assessment tool may over- or under-
               estimate lean mass compared to a reference standard at a given time point. Most
               relevant is that the method of choice is reliable, providing consistent measurements
               from one assessment to the next. For example, single time point analysis shows
               multifrequency BIA overestimates fat-free mass by 0.58 to 0.84 kg (1.3 to 1.8 lb)
               compared with DXA (61). However, if one’s primary objective is to determine the
               extent to which fat-free mass changes in conjunction with an exercise program, these
               differences essentially would be moot provided the same absolute magnitude of
               error persists on a consistent basis. That said, there is evidence that the magnitude
               of error may change with alterations in body composition (25, 55, 74), presumably
               because the density of fat-free mass is altered with changes in body weight, violating
               the assumption that it remains constant. Monitoring large changes in muscle mass
               using indirect measurement tools therefore should be treated more skeptically when
               examining individual-level data.

          •   No single measurement tool provides comprehensive insights into muscle
              hypertrophy and its associated changes over time.
          •   All methods of measurement offer advantages and disadvantages.
          •   Indirect measures of hypertrophy lack the ability to detect subtle changes
              in muscle mass over time.
          •   Muscle volume provides an estimate of whole-muscle changes but does not
              account for potential regional hypertrophic differences.
          •   Muscle biopsy is the only method capable of providing information about
              fiber type–specific hypertrophy and differences between protein subfractions
              (sarcoplasmic versus contractile) within muscle.
          •   Combining multiple types of methods is needed to provide a complete
              picture of muscle development in a given individual or group of individuals.

                         PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                          VOLUME
                          Evidence for a dose–response relationship between volume and hypertrophy is
                          compelling: Higher training volumes are positively associated with greater muscular
                          gains. A volume of approximately 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week appears to
                          be a good general recommendation for hypertrophy-related goals. More advanced
                          lifters seem to require greater volumes to maximize muscle protein accretion and
                          thus might need to train at the higher end of these recommendations; experimen-
                          tation is warranted to determine individual responsiveness. There may be a benefit
                          to selectively employing even higher volumes to bring up lagging muscle groups.
                          Given that consistently employing high volumes over time hastens the onset of
                          overtraining, periodizing programming by progressively increasing volume over the
                          course of a training cycle appears beneficial. Moreover, periods of reduced training
                          volume should be integrated regularly to facilitate the recovery process and resen-

           between studies, a possible explanation may be                        additional benefits to higher-volume training
           related to the composition of the routines in                         used split routines with the volume for each

            PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                  FREQUENCY
                  Modulating training frequency is an effective way to manipulate training volume.
                  When performing relatively low weekly volumes, frequency of training does not play
                  much if any role in muscle growth, and individuals can choose the frequency that
                  best fits their schedule and goals. Alternatively, when moderate to high volumes are
                  performed (>10 sets per muscle per week), higher training frequencies (at least twice
                  per week) provide better volume management and thus facilitate greater muscular
                  adaptations. If very high volumes are implemented for a given muscle group (~30
                  sets per muscle per week), spreading training across at least 3 weekly sessions
                  appears to be warranted. Very high training frequencies (6 days per week) do not
                  appear to be more effective than moderately high frequencies (3 days per week) for
                  enhancing hypertrophy, although limited evidence precludes the ability to draw strong
                  inferences on the topic. Although both total-body and split routines can be viable
                  training strategies, dividing workouts by body region (e.g., upper and lower, pushing
                  and pulling) may be more effective when training with higher volumes because it
                  allows higher weekly frequencies (and thus shorter sessions) while affording greater
                  muscular recuperation between workouts.

      Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy




             PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                LOAD
                Hypertrophy can be achieved across a wide spectrum of loading zones, with no
                differences apparent at the whole-muscle level. Low-load training emphasizes
                metabolic stress and promotes the greatest increases in local muscular endur-
                ance, whereas low-repetition, high-load training requires high levels of mechanical
                tension and enhances the ability to lift heavier loads as a result of greater neural
                adaptations. Some evidence suggests there may be a fiber type–specific response
                in which heavy-load training produces greater cross-sectional area increases in Type
                II fibers, and light loads have a preferential effect on Type I hypertrophy. Thus, if the
                primary goal is maximizing hypertrophy without regard to strength-related factors,
                then training across a wide spectrum of repetition ranges (1 through 20+) is recom-
                mended to exploit all possible avenues for the complete development of the whole
                muscle. There is merit to focusing on a medium-repetition range (6RM to 12RM)
                because it provides high levels of mechanical tension sufficient to stimulate the
                full array of fiber types while allowing for sufficient training volumes. Incorporating
                heavy loading (1RM to 5RM) enhances strength, which ultimately allows the use of
                heavier loads during medium-repetition lifting. Additionally, light-load training should
                be included both to ensure the optimal development of Type I fibers and to improve
                the buffering capacity of muscle so that additional repetitions can be performed at a
                given medium intensity of load. Training below approximately 30% of 1RM may be
                insufficient to fully stimulate optimal muscular development, although its potential
                ability to selectively target development of Type I fibers remains to be determined.
                    On the other hand, if the goal is to promote hypertrophy to maximize muscular
                strength, there appears little reason to employ loads less than approximately 70%
                of 1RM, other than perhaps during deload periods. The compelling body of research
                indicates the presence of a strength–endurance continuum, in which lighter loads
                promote the ability to carry out submaximal resistive efforts at the expense of max-
                imal force production (39).

       PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
          EXERCISE SELECTION
          Architectural variances of individual muscles lend support to the notion of the need
          to adopt a multiplanar, multiangled approach to hypertrophy training using a variety of
          exercises. Moreover, evidence suggests that regular exercise rotation is warranted to
          fully stimulate all fibers within a muscle and thus maximize the hypertrophic response.
             As mentioned in chapter 1, neural mechanisms are primarily responsible for
          increases in strength during the early stages of resistance training. Thus, lifters in
          the initial training phase should focus on acquiring the necessary motor learning and
          control to effectively carry out exercise performance. Simplification and repeated
          practice are important in this context. Performing the same movements over and over
          ingrains motor patterns so that proper technique becomes second nature. For those
          who have difficulty with coordination, reducing degrees of freedom with machine-
          based training can be an effective means to enhance neural development. They can
          then progress to more complex variations in three-dimensional space.
             A variety of exercises should be employed over the course of a periodized training
          program to maximize whole-body muscle hypertrophy, with a particular focus on
          working muscles based on their anatomical design. This should include a combination
          of free-form exercises (i.e., free weights and cables) that maximize the contribution
          of stabilizer muscles, as well as machine-based movements that target specific
          muscles or portions thereof. Similarly, both multi- and single-joint exercises should
          be included in a hypertrophy-specific routine to maximize muscular growth.

          Both concentric and eccentric actions should be included in hypertrophy-oriented

                      PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                       REST INTERVAL LENGTH
                       Despite a theoretical concept that shorter rest intervals produce superior muscular
                       adaptations, current research does not support such a contention. In fact, longer
                       interset rest periods may enhance hypertrophy by allowing for maintenance of a
                       greater volume load. Thus, resistance training protocols should generally provide
                       rest periods of at least 2 minutes to maximize the hypertrophic response, at least
                       when performing multi-joint free weight exercises.
                          That said, it may be beneficial to employ rest intervals of approximately 60 to
                       90 seconds for single-joint and perhaps certain machine-based exercises because
                       these movements do not show a reduction in volume load from shorter rest, and
                       the heightened metabolic stress may perhaps confer additional anabolic advantages.
                       Evidence suggests that consistently training with shorter rest intervals promotes
                       adaptations that facilitate the ability to sustain a significantly higher mean percent-
                       age of 1RM during training (124). These adaptations include increased capillary and
                       mitochondrial density as well as an improved capacity to buffer hydrogen ions and
                       shuttle them out of muscle, thereby minimizing performance decrements. Conceiv-
                       ably, this could allow maintenance of volume with even greater levels of metabolic
                       stress, potentially enhancing anabolism.

                    PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                       REPETITION DURATION
                       Current evidence suggests little difference in muscle hypertrophy when training
                       with isotonic repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 6 seconds to muscular failure.
                       Thus, it would seem that a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be used if
                       the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Research is limited on the topic,
                       making it difficult to draw concrete conclusions. Concentric tempos of 1 to 3 seconds
                       can be considered viable options; an eccentric tempo of at least 2 seconds appears
                       necessary to ensure loads are lowered under muscular control. On the other hand,
                       training at very slow volitional durations (>10 seconds per repetition) appears to
                       produce inferior increases in muscle growth, although a lack of controlled studies
                       on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. It is conceivable that
                       combining different repetition durations could enhance the hypertrophic response
                       to resistance training, although this hypothesis requires further study.
                          Developing a strong mind–muscle connection is perhaps the most important
                       consideration in regard to repetition duration. By focusing on actively contracting the
                       target muscle throughout the range of motion of a given exercise, maximal mechan-
                       ical forces are directed to the musculature, heightening the degree of stimulation.

             PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                IS THERE AN IDEAL TIME UNDER TENSION TO
                MAXIMIZE MUSCLE GROWTH?
                While resistance training volume is generally thought of in terms of sets, repetitions,
                and total work, a concept called time under tension (TUT) also can be considered a
                relevant variable. TUT can be operationally defined as the total amount of time that a
                muscle, or group of muscles, endures mechanical stress during resistance exercise.
                Anecdotally, some fitness professionals have put forth the claim that sets should
                have a TUT of 40 to 60 seconds to optimally build muscle.
                   Research into the role of TUT in muscle development is limited. In one of the few
                studies that attempted to directly investigate the topic, Burd and colleagues (32) car-
                ried out an acute, within-subject design in which subjects performed a leg extension
                exercise at 30% of 1RM with a slow tempo (6-0-6) with one leg and trained the other
                leg at the same intensity of load with a fast tempo (1-0-1). Three sets were performed
                for each condition with a 2-minute rest interval between sets, resulting in a 6-fold
                greater TUT in the slow-tempo condition. Post-exercise muscle biopsies showed sig-
                nificantly greater increases in myofibrillar protein synthesis and intracellular anabolic
                signaling favoring the slow-tempo condition; differences primarily manifested 24 to
                30 hours after the training bout. While on the surface these findings seemingly sup-
                port the importance of TUT as a driver of hypertrophy, conclusions were confounded
                by the fact that people in the slow-tempo condition performed all sets to volitional
                failure while the number of repetitions performed for the fast-tempo condition were
                matched to that of the slow-tempo condition. Thus, rather than providing insights into
                the hypertrophic effects of TUT, the results reinforce the importance of challenging
                the muscles with a high level of effort for muscle building.
                   Studies comparing superslow training to traditional training whereby both condi-
                tions are performed to volitional fatigue have not shown a benefit from higher TUTs; in
                fact, evidence indicates training in a traditional fashion produces superior hypertrophy
                despite a substantially lower TUT (221). A caveat to these findings is that the higher
                TUT in the superslow condition was at the expense of a much lower intensity of load.
                How these variables interact with one another to affect muscle growth is not clear.
                   Despite the paucity of objective evidence, a logical case can be made that TUT
                does play a role in hypertrophy. However, it appears the effects are more related
                to the time a muscle is worked over the duration of a training session than to the
                TUT for a given set. In support of this hypothesis, my lab showed that performing a
                powerlifting-style workout consisting of 7 sets of 3RM produced increases in muscle
                growth similar to those of a bodybuilding-style workout consisting of 3 sets of 10RM
                (208). Although TUT in the powerlifting-style sets was markedly lower than in the
                bodybuilding-style sets (~9 seconds vs. ~30 seconds, respectively), the total TUT
                for the training session was approximately equal because of the greater number of
                sets performed for the powerlifting-style condition. These findings are in contrast to
                a follow-up study showing that when the total number of sets were equated, a body-
                building-style workout (10RM) elicited greater hypertrophic adaptations compared to
                a powerlifting-style workout (3RM) (213). Here, the TUT was markedly greater both
                during each set as well as over the course of the training session.
                   It also can be hypothesized that not all repetitions equally contribute to hyper-
                trophy. For example, the initial repetitions in a set of 25RM are relatively easy to

         execute; only when fatigue begins to manifest does the set become challenging. In
         contrast, the initial repetitions during a 6RM set are substantially more challenging
         to complete from the outset, and conceivably would promote greater anabolic stim-
         ulation. A case therefore can be made that the TUT in the 6RM protocol would have
         greater hypertrophic relevance than that of the higher-repetition set. Hence, to some
         extent TUT should be considered in the context of the repetition range in which a
         set is performed and the corresponding duration of repetitions that are challenging
         to complete.
            Another inherent issue with TUT is that it considers the duration of the repetitions
         as a whole and thus neglects to take into account the individual portion of the actions.
         For example, a set carried out at a 4-0-1 tempo (4-second concentric actions, 1-second
         eccentric actions) would have the same TUT as a set carried out at a 1-0-4 tempo
         (1-second concentric actions, 4-second eccentric actions), provided the number of
         repetitions is equated between sets. This has potentially important implications given
         the research that shows differential intracellular signaling and hypertrophy responses
         (72) between concentric and eccentric actions.
            All things considered, evidence indicates that TUT plays a role in muscle hypertro-
         phy. However, its implications must be considered in the context of the resistance
         training variables comprising a given routine (i.e., repetition range, tempo of eccentric
         versus concentric actions). Within limits, it appears that the total TUT accumulated
         for a muscle group in a given session, or perhaps over time (e.g., weekly), has the
         most relevance from a muscle growth standpoint. A rationale for speculation exists
         whereby a longer TUT (>60 seconds per set) may be beneficial for targeting hyper-
         trophy of Type I muscle fibers; this hypothesis warrants further exploration.

      in the group that performed small-muscle-               after arm training (269). Ronnestad and col-

             PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                EXERCISE ORDER
                Evidence indicates a hypertrophic benefit for muscles worked first in a resistance
                training bout. Therefore, exercise order should be prioritized so that lagging muscles
                are trained earlier in the session. In this way, the person expends the greatest energy
                and focus on the sets of most importance. Whether the muscle group is large or
                small is of secondary concern.

         PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
            RANGE OF MOTION
            Maximal muscle development requires training through a complete ROM. Thus, full
            ROM movements should form the basis of a hypertrophy-oriented program. The
            stretched position appears particularly important in eliciting hypertrophic gains. That
            said, integrating partial-range movements may help to enhance hypertrophy.

        PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
          INTENSITY OF EFFORT
          Although research remains somewhat equivocal, there is logical rationale for per-
          forming at least some sets to failure in a hypertrophy-oriented program, especially
          in individuals with considerable training experience. This seems to be of particular
          importance when employing high-repetition training because of the relationship
          between the proximity to failure and muscle activation during light-load training,
          and with increasingly greater resistance training experience. However, persistently
          training to failure increases the potential for nonfunctional overreaching and perhaps
          overtraining.
             When taking all factors into account, it is recommended that most sets are carried
          out with an RIR of 1 or 2. Failure training should then be implemented selectively,
          usually reserved for the last set of a given exercise. As a general rule, failure should
          be used more judiciously with multi-joint exercises, while a more liberal approach
          can be employed with single-joint movements. The frequency of failure training
          also can be periodized to bring about a supercompensatory response. An example
          would be performing an initial cycle in which all sets are stopped a repetition or two
          short of failure, followed by taking the last set of each exercise to failure, and then
          culminating in a brief cycle in which the majority of sets are carried out to failure.

      Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy




                                           TAKE-HOME POINTS
             •   Multiset protocols favoring higher volumes of resistance training optimize the
                 hypertrophic response. A range of 10 to 20 sets per muscle is a general guideline
                 for weekly volume prescription. That said, there is a fairly wide interindividual
                 response to the volume dose, and thus some people will thrive on somewhat
                 lower volumes, while others will benefit from slightly higher volumes. Strate-
                 gic use of very high volumes (~30+ sets per muscle) can be employed to help
                 bring up lagging muscle groups. To avoid overtraining, overall volume should
                 be progressively increased over the course of a training cycle; periods of reduced
                 training volume should be integrated regularly to facilitate the recovery process.
             •   When employing lower total volumes, training frequency does not seem to play
                 much if any role in muscle growth. In these cases, individuals can choose the
                 frequency that best fits their schedule and goals. Alternatively, when moderate
                 to higher volumes are performed (>10 sets per muscle per week), higher training
                 frequencies (at least twice per week) allow for better volume management, thus
                 facilitating greater muscular adaptations. Although both total-body and split
                 routines can be viable training strategies, splitting workouts by body region or
                 function (e.g., upper and lower, pushing and pulling) may be superior when
                 training with higher volumes because it allows for higher weekly frequencies (and
                 thus shorter sessions) while affording greater muscular recuperation between
                 workouts.
             •   Training across a wide spectrum of repetition ranges (1 to 20+) is recommended
                 to ensure complete whole-muscle development. From an efficiency standpoint,
                 there is merit to focusing on a medium-repetition range (6RM to 12RM) and
                 devoting specific training cycles or sessions to lower- and higher-repetition
                 training.
             •   Once competency in the basic movement patterns has been established, a vari-
                 ety of exercises should be employed over the course of a periodized training
                 program to maximize whole-body muscle hypertrophy, with a particular focus
                 on working muscles based on their anatomical design. This should include the
                 liberal use of free-form (i.e., free weights and cables) and machine-based exer-
                 cises. Similarly, both multi- and single-joint exercises should be included in a
                 hypertrophy-specific routine to maximize muscular growth.
             •   Both concentric and eccentric actions should be incorporated during training.
                 Evidence of the benefits of combining isometric actions with dynamic actions
                 is lacking at this time. The addition of supramaximal eccentric loading may
                 enhance the hypertrophic response.
             •   An optimal rest interval for hypertrophy training does not appear to exist.
                 Research indicates that resting at least 2 minutes between sets provides a hyper-
                 trophic advantage over resting for shorter periods, at least when performing
                 multi-joint free weight exercises. It may be beneficial to employ rest intervals of
                 approximately 60 to 90 seconds for single-joint and perhaps certain machine-
                 based exercises because these movements do not show a reduction in volume
                 load from shorter rest, and the heightened metabolic stress may confer additional
                 anabolic advantages.
             •   Current evidence suggests little difference in muscle hypertrophy when training
                 with isotonic repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 6 seconds to muscular
                 failure. Thus, a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the

    primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Training at very slow volitional
    durations (>10 seconds per repetition) appears to be suboptimal for increasing
    muscle size and thus should be avoided. A more important consideration is to
    develop a strong mind–muscle connection, which involves focusing on actively
    contracting the target muscle throughout the range of motion of a given exercise.
    If the target muscle is forced to work over the entire concentric and eccentric
    portions of movement, tempo becomes largely moot.
•   Evidence indicates a hypertrophic benefit for muscles worked first in a resistance
    training bout. Therefore, lagging muscles should be trained earlier in the session.
•   Full-ROM movements should form the basis of a hypertrophy-oriented program.
    Integrating partial-range movements may enhance hypertrophic adaptations.
•   Hypertrophy-oriented programs should include sets taken to muscular failure as
    well as those that are terminated short of an all-out effort. As a general rule, most
    sets should be carried out with an RIR of 1 or 2. Failure training should then be
    implemented selectively, generally reserved for the last set of a given exercise.
    Failure training should be used more judiciously with multi-joint exercises,
    while a more liberal approach can be employed with single-joint movements.

  KEY POINT
  It is not clear whether the use of intraset rest training is a viable strategy for enhancing the hy-
  pertrophic response to resistance training. Although it appears the increase in training volume
  may translate into greater gains in muscle size, the reduction in constant tension and corre-
  sponding metabolite accumulation may counteract any potential benefits and possibly have a
  negative effect on hypertrophic outcomes (36). As noted, longitudinal research is limited, and
  the existing data is conflicting, precluding the ability to draw strong conclusions into potential
  benefits or detriments of intraset rest. The differences in the duration of intraset rest periods
  further clouds the ability to infer causality.
     It can be speculated that the best use of intraset rest training may be to implement it in a
  manner similar to the protocol of Prestes and colleagues (69), whereby a set is carried out at a
  high level of effort and short rest periods (~10 to 20 seconds) taken between repetitions. From
  a practical standpoint, it is important to completely unload during the rest phase so that suffi-
  cient recovery is attained. For example, in exercises such as the squat or bench press, the lifter
  should rerack the weights to prevent unwanted fatigue from isometrically holding the load,
  which would impair performance on subsequent repetitions.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
 COLD-WATER IMMERSION: HYPERTROPHIC FRIEND
 OR FOE?
 Proper recovery from training is considered essential to optimizing muscle gains.
 Various passive techniques have been advocated to enhance the post-exercise recov-
 ery process and restore the body to its normal physiological and psychological state.
 Cold-water immersion is one of the most commonly used modalities in this regard.
 The technique involves immersing all or part of the body in cold water (figure 5.1).
 The specific protocols vary, but prescriptions generally include water temperatures
 cooler than 15 °C (59 °F), with immersion durations of at least 10 minutes (12).
     The findings of several systematic
 reviews and meta-analyses indicate that
 cold-water immersion helps to attenuate
 delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
 (8, 9, 46). Given that DOMS may impede
 lifting performance, the use of cold-wa-
 ter immersion seems to be of potential
 benefit for those involved in intensive
 resistance training programs. However,
 despite its potential recovery-related
 benefits, emerging evidence indicates
 that cold-water immersion may be det-
 rimental to muscle development.
     Acute research shows that cold-water FIGURE 5.1 An athlete in cold-water immersion.

 signaling, and an attenuated p70 S6K
 phosphorylation response is seen over the course of a 48-hour recovery period after
 resistance training compared to an active recovery period (72). The same study also
 showed cold-water immersion mitigated the number of Pax7+ cells and NCAM+
 cells at 24 and 48 hours after resistance exercise, indicating a deleterious effect
 on the satellite cell response to resistance training as well. Other research shows
 cold-water immersion suppresses ribosome biogenesis (21), which is thought to be
 a key player in the long-term regulation of muscle growth (22).
     The negative acute effects on anabolism seen with cold-water immersion align
 with findings of longitudinal research on hypertrophic outcomes. Roberts and col-
 leagues (72) investigated the impact of cold-water immersion versus active recovery
 during a 12-week resistance training program. Twenty-four physically active young
 men were randomly assigned to one of the two recovery conditions. Cold-water
 immersion was initiated within 5 minutes post-exercise and involved sitting waist
 deep in water approximately 10 °C (50 °F) in an inflatable bath for 10 minutes. Those
 in the active recovery group cycled on an ergometer at a self-selected low intensity
 for 10 minutes. Results demonstrated a blunting of both whole-muscle hypertro-
 phy and histological measures of Type II fiber cross-sectional area with the use of
 cold-water immersion. Similar findings were observed by Yamane and colleagues
 (90), who compared muscular adaptations between cold-water immersion and pas-
 sive rest following a 6-week resistance training program of the wrist flexor muscles.
 Cold-water immersion treatment consisted of immersing the trained arms in a water

                bath within 3 minutes post-exercise. Water temperature was maintained at 10 °C
                (50 °F), with immersion lasting for 20 minutes. Results showed that both groups
                increased thickness of the wrist flexors, but hypertrophy was significantly greater in
                the passive recovery condition.
                   The underlying mechanisms by which cold-water immersion impedes anabolism
                remain unclear. Given that the acute inflammatory response to resistance training is
                implicated in anabolic signaling (75), and given that cold-water immersion alleviates
                symptoms of DOMS, which is associated with induction of acute inflammation, it
                would be logical to speculate that the anti-inflammatory effects induced by cold-wa-
                ter immersion play a mechanistic role. However, research on the topic is somewhat
                contradictory. Peake and colleagues (67) found that cold-water immersion did not
                alter post-exercise levels of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins, or intra-
                muscular translocation of heat shock proteins compared to active recovery following
                resistance training. Alternatively, Pournot and colleagues (68) reported a diminished
                inflammatory response when cold-water immersion was applied pursuant to an
                endurance exercise bout.
                   It can be hypothesized that negative anabolic effects of cold-water immersion are
                in some way related to a reduction in blood flow (50, 54), possibly by compromising
                post-exercise amino acid delivery to muscle (29). Exposure to cold temperatures also
                has been shown to interfere with anabolic signaling, potentially via an upregulation
                of AMPK, a known inhibitor of mTOR (12). Because research is limited, it is difficult
                to draw strong inferences on the topic.
                   In summary, current evidence contraindicates the use of cold-water immersion
                for those seeking to maximize muscular development, at least when used regularly.
                Any benefits to recovery seem to be outweighed by an impaired anabolic response
                to resistance training. Post-exercise heat therapy represents a promising strategy
                for enhancing recovery without interfering with hypertrophic outcomes and possibly
                even improving subsequent strength-related performance (13). Evidence shows that
                heat therapy, applied 2 hours daily over 10 days of immobilization, can attenuate skel-
                etal muscle atrophy (38). Although this finding indicates potential anabolic effects,
                results cannot be extrapolated to benefits during performance of muscle-building
                protocols. Another study demonstrated that topical application of heat via a heat- and
                steam-generating sheet for 8 hours per day for 4 days a week significantly increased
                quadriceps hypertrophy over a 10-week treatment period (34). Research into this
                modality is preliminary and warrants further study.

       PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
         STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING DELAYED-ONSET
         MUSCLE SORENESS
         As discussed in chapter 2, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) manifests 24 to 48
         hours after performance of intense exercise and tends to be most prevalent when the
         stimulus is unaccustomed. While mild DOMS generally is benign from a performance
         standpoint, moderate to severe levels of soreness can impair subsequent strength
         capacity, thereby potentially having a detrimental impact on muscular adaptations.
            Numerous strategies have been proposed to help alleviate the negative conse-
         quences of DOMS (15). A recent meta-analysis on the topic found that massage
         therapy had the greatest effect on reducing symptoms of DOMS, conceivably by
         increasing blood flow and diminishing edema. Other strategies shown to have a
         positive impact include compressive garments, cryotherapy, cold-water immersion,
         contrast water therapy (i.e., alternating hot- and cold-water baths), and active recov-
         ery. Interestingly, evidence did not show a beneficial effect of stretching on DOMS,
         despite its popular use as a primary treatment.
            Recently, foam rolling has been advocated for counteracting DOMS. Drinkwater and
         colleagues (14) found that 15 minutes of foam rolling for the lower-body musculature
         performed immediately after a muscle-damaging eccentric bout and 24, 48, and 72
         hours post-exercise significantly increased the pressure–pain threshold compared to
         passive recovery. These findings were associated with a greater recovery from the
         exercise bout, as determined by an increase in countermovement jump performance.
         Although speculative, a higher pressure–pain threshold conceivably could be related
         to a reduction in soreness, thereby raising the possibility that foam rolling may be a
         viable recovery option.
            A potential issue when interpreting research on the topic is the possibility that
         findings are due to a placebo effect. It is difficult to provide adequate sham treat-
         ments as a control for manipulative therapies, and subjects therefore are not ade-
         quately blinded to the given treatment. This limits the ability to conclude whether
         the treatment is actually responsible for beneficial effects or if results are influenced
         by subjects’ perception of treatment.
            Importantly, while reducing DOMS potentially can benefit performance, some
         therapies may interfere with processes beneficial to muscle development. As
         noted elsewhere in this chapter, evidence shows that cold-water immersion ther-
         apy negatively affects anabolic processes (21, 72) and appears to be detrimental to
         long-term muscle development (72, 90). Caution should therefore be used when
         deciding whether to use a recovery strategy to optimize hypertrophic adaptations;
         the potential costs and benefits of adopting a given approach must both be taken
         into consideration.

                             TAKE-HOME POINTS
•   Advanced training strategies can potentially augment hypertrophic adaptations;
    however, the overall paucity of evidence on the topic limits the ability to draw
    strong conclusions about best practices.
•   Eccentric overload training has the greatest research-based support for enhanc-
    ing muscle development. However, evidence remains insufficient to develop
    evidence-based guidelines for the best way to implement the strategy in practice.
•   Although strategies such as supersets and drop sets generally have not been found
    to promote greater hypertrophic increases compared to traditional training, they
    can provide more efficient training alternatives without compromising muscle
    growth.
•   Given the lack of research on many of these strategies, personal experimentation
    is warranted to determine individual response within the context of a given
    training program.
•   Many advanced training strategies can be highly taxing to the neuromuscular
    system, and their persistent use may potentially hasten the onset of overtrain-
    ing. A conservative approach is therefore warranted when implementing such
    strategies into a training program, and periodization (see chapter 8) should be
    considered for achieving an optimal cost/benefit ratio.

       PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
          INTENSITY, FREQUENCY, VOLUME, AND MODE OF
          AEROBIC TRAINING
          Aerobic exercise can increase hypertrophy in sedentary people, primarily in Type I
          muscle fibers. The extent of hypertrophic increases depends on the level of sedenta-
          rism; greater gains are seen in the elderly than in the young. Intensities of ≥80% of
          HRR are generally needed to elicit significant muscular growth. Although definitive
          evidence regarding the effects of aerobic volume on hypertrophy is lacking, research
          indicates that longer periods of sedentarism reduce the total weekly duration required
          to promote the accretion of lean mass. With respect to the modality of exercise,
          cycling appears to have the greatest hypertrophic benefit, although the paucity of
          studies on alternative modalities makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on this
          variable. Importantly, muscular gains are limited to the early phases after initiating a
          regimented aerobic exercise program. Results plateau in a relatively short time, and
          evidence suggests that persistent aerobic training can actually have a detrimental
          impact on Type II fiber hypertrophy.

             RESEARCH FINDINGS
                 CONCURRENT TRAINING
                 Research indicates that concurrent training can have a negative impact on hypertrophic
                 adaptations. Mitigating aerobic volume or intensity, or both, reduces the potential
                 for negative consequences associated with the strategy. Non-weight-bearing aer-
                 obic activities such as cycling appear to attenuate deleterious effects compared to
                 running, although some evidence is contradictory. There is an absence of research
                 on the effects of cross-training on various modalities in the context of a regimented
                 resistance training program. Whether such variation would enhance or hinder results
                 remains speculative.
                     The majority of concurrent training studies have been carried out with untrained
                 subjects, making it difficult to extrapolate conclusions to physically active people. The
                 few studies that have employed subjects experienced in exercise training indicate
                 greater interference in those who are well trained. Kraemer and colleagues (52)

                 recruits involved in standard military training for at least 3 days per week for 2 years
                 before the onset of the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to perform aerobic
                 endurance exercise, resistance exercise, or concurrent training. The aerobic endur-
                 ance protocol consisted of a combination of steady-state and high-intensity interval
                 training. After 12 weeks, subjects in the resistance-only group displayed increases in
                 Type I, Type IIa, and Type IIc fiber diameters, whereas those in the concurrent group
                 showed significant increases only in Type IIa fibers. Bell and colleagues (8) found sim-
                 ilar results in a group of physically active university students, at least some of whom
                 had experience in strength and aerobic endurance training. Subjects performed 12
                 weeks of cycle ergometry, resistance training, or a combination of both modalities.
                 Results showed that resistance training only increased both Type I and Type II fiber
                 cross-sectional area, whereas concurrent training produced increases only in Type II
                 fibers. Moreover, the magnitude of Type II fiber hypertrophy was markedly greater
                 in the resistance-only group compared to those who performed concurrent training
                 (28% vs. 14%, respectively). Taken together, these findings suggest that concurrent
                 training may be particularly detrimental to well-trained individuals.
                     Consideration also must be given to the relatively short duration of most concur-
                 rent training studies. Hickson (40) found no evidence of interference in a combined
                 aerobic and resistance protocol until the 8th week of training. This finding indicates
                 that negative effects on hypertrophy may not manifest for months, but ultimately
                 long-term increases in muscle size may be compromised, conceivably as a result of
                 nonfunctional overreaching/overtraining.

       •   Aerobic exercise can promote increases in muscle hypertrophy in untrained
           people, and gains are primarily limited to Type I fibers. The extent of hypertro-
           phic adaptations is contingent on intensity, volume, frequency, and mode of
           training, as well as the person’s level of deconditioning.
       •   Aerobic intensities of >80% of HRR are generally required to promote gains in
           muscle mass in untrained people.
       •   Although highly deconditioned people can experience hypertrophic increases
           with relatively low volumes of aerobic training, those who are more active require
           higher training volumes.
       •   Evidence suggests that cycling exercise may be more conducive to increasing
           muscle mass than walking, running, or jogging, possibly because ambulatory
           activities are performed more often in daily life.
       •   Concurrent training can interfere with hypertrophic adaptations. Higher aerobic
           volumes appear particularly detrimental in this regard, although the effect of
           high aerobic intensities is not well elucidated.
       •   The negative effects of concurrent training are best minimized by either inserting
           a lengthy intervening recovery period between aerobic and resistance bouts or,
           perhaps even better, performing them on separate days.
       •   If properly structured, the addition of aerobic exercise to a resistance training
           program may facilitate better long-term hypertrophic increases via beneficial
           effects of angiogenesis.

       RESEARCH FINDINGS
           DO MUSCLES HAVE AN EPIGENETIC MEMORY?
           Much like the brain, skeletal muscles are said to have a “memory” that allows them
           to recall previous mechanical events. Skeletal muscle memory refers to both cellular
           and tissue retention of prior stimuli (e.g., stress from exercise) that leads to a mod-
           ified response if the stimulus is reencountered (77). While traditionally the concept
           of muscle memory applied to relearning a motor task, recent evidence indicates that
           it also may have relevance to hypertrophy.
               In chapter 1, we discussed that satellite cells provide memory for muscles, and
           hypertrophy lost through detraining is regained when training resumes because of
           the retention of myonuclei that facilitate a greater transcriptional potential of the
           fibers. It has been hypothesized that muscles also possess an epigenetic (trans-
           lated as “above genetics”) memory that further enhances hypertrophic adaptations
           after reintroduction to anabolic stimuli. Epigenetics can be operationally defined as
           changes in the activity and expression of genes brought about by structural cellular
           modifications without altering the genetic code (77). These modifications are primarily
           specific to DNA and histones (e.g., methylation and acetylation), but they also can
           apply to posttranscriptional alterations of RNA. An attenuation in DNA methylation of
           genes mediates enhancements in gene expression because removing methylation
           affords greater access to the machinery that facilitates gene transcription (75).
               An emerging body of research supports the concept of epigenetic muscle memory.
           Acute exercise demethylates various promoters of given genes, resulting in expres-
           sion of the associated genes. Demethylation is specific to the intensity of aerobic
           exercise, with higher intensities targeting genes such as PPAR-γ, PGC-1α, PDK4, and

           as with PPAR-δ), 3 hours post-workout (55). What is most interesting is that muscles
           apparently are able to retain this molecular information and use it later when faced
           with the same exercise stressor to facilitate appropriate adaptations.
               Seminal work from the lab of Adam Sharples provides evidence that epigenetic
           memory extends to hypertrophic adaptations obtained from resistance training
           (75). Employing a within-subject design, untrained men performed 7 weeks of reg-
           imented total-body progressive resistance exercise carried out 3 days a week. This
           was followed by a 7-week detraining period in which no exercise was performed.
           Subjects then reengaged in the same exercise for an additional 7 weeks. Results
           indicated that various hypertrophy-related genes in the trained muscles remained in a
           hypomethylated state during detraining, and their expression was switched on to an
           even greater extent upon retraining. Several genes in particular showed significantly
           enhanced expression upon reloading (RPL35a, UBR5, SETD3, and PLA2G16), and
           their expression was highly correlated with the change in lean mass.

                Do Muscles Have an Epigenetic Memory? (continued)

                   The UBR5 gene appears especially relevant to exercise-induced hypertrophy
                because it has been found to be involved at the DNA-methylation, gene, and protein
                level in recovery and growth across human, mouse, and rat studies. Human genetic
                association research (examining over 700,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms
                across the genome) demonstrates that certain polymorphisms of the UBR5 gene
                are strongly associated with a larger cross-sectional area of fast-twitch muscle fibers,
                and occur more frequently in strength and power athletes compared with endurance
                athletes and untrained individuals (76). Although speculative, the findings suggest
                that individuals possessing these UBR5 polymorphisms may have both a genetic
                and an epigenetic propensity for muscle memory.
                   Taken with evidence that satellite cells also possess a “memory,” the findings
                highlight the unique capabilities of muscle to respond and adapt to stimuli. Impor-
                tantly, these adaptive capabilities are constantly evolving, suggesting that a person’s
                hypertrophic responsiveness is, at least in part, predicated on previous training expe-
                rience. It also provides a basis for speculation that brief periods of reduced loading
                do not negatively affect growth, and in fact may present a strategy to resensitize the
                anabolic capacity of muscle and thus spur future hypertrophic gains.

                                     TAKE-HOME POINTS

       •   There is a large genetic component in the individual hypertrophic response. A
           wide array of genes have been identified as playing a role in the ability to gain
           muscle. It is likely that interactions of multiple genetic loci ultimately determine
           a person’s genetic potential to gain muscle. Hereditary differences in muscle
           morphology also are believed to govern the extent of a person’s muscle-building
           capacity. Although the terms responders and nonresponders have been discussed
           in the literature, these classifications are overly simplistic; virtually everyone can
           increase muscle mass above baseline levels with consistent resistance training over
           time, but the ultimate extent of hypertrophy will vary greatly between individuals.
       •   Biological aging has a marked effect on muscle mass. Peak mass is achieved
           between the third and fifth decades of life, after which a gradual, progressive
           loss of muscle ensues (i.e., sarcopenia). An age-related reduction in anabolic
           hormones and satellite cell function are believed to be largely responsible for
           sarcopenic changes. Chronic low-grade inflammation also appears to play a role
           in the process. Regular resistance exercise can help abate age-related muscle loss
           and even produce hypertrophic increases above that in sedentary younger people.
           However, hypertrophic potential diminishes with advancing age, and evidence
           indicates that elderly people need a greater weekly minimum training dose to
           maintain muscle once they have achieved a given level of hypertrophy.
       •   The ability to build muscle differs between the sexes. Although women attain
           approximately equal relative muscle growth compared to men following regi-
           mented resistance training, men gain significantly more muscle on an absolute
           basis. These differences are seemingly attributed, at least in part, to variances in
           circulating testosterone. Women tend to experience a greater age-related muscle
           loss than men, conceivably mediated by postmenopausal reductions in estrogen
           levels.
       •   Hypertrophic capacity progressively diminishes as people become more trained.
           This is attributed to a ceiling effect in which alterations in anabolic intracellular
           signaling impair the ability to accrete muscle proteins with consistent partici-
           pation in a resistance training program. However, although a theoretical ceiling
           does exist, people never actually realize their full genetic potential; the ability
           to further increase muscle mass is always present.

            PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
               ATTENTIONAL FOCUS AND MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY
               Attentional focus is a well-recognized aspect of motor learning and its use has impor-
               tant implications for muscular hypertrophy. Operationally defined from a resistance
               training standpoint, attentional focus refers to what a person thinks about during
               each repetition. Two primary types of attentional focus have been recognized in the
               literature: internal and external. An internal focus involves thinking about bodily
               movements during performance, whereas an external focus involves thinking about
               the outcomes of movements.
                   The majority of research supports adopting an external focus of attention when
               carrying out performance-oriented tasks. A recent comprehensive review of the
               literature found superior effects from using an external versus an internal focus in
               more than 90% of studies that examined performance-oriented outcomes (151).
               The performance-based superiority of an external focus during resistance training is
               thought to be due to an enhanced economy of movement associated with greater
               force production and reduced muscular activity compared to an internal focus (con-
               strained action hypothesis) (86). It is important to note, however, that improvements
               in performance-related measures do not necessarily equate to maximal increases in
               muscle hypertrophy. A case can be made that an internal focus is a better approach
               when the goal is to maximize muscle development.
                   Employing a hypertrophy-oriented internal focus of attention is consistent with the
               long-standing bodybuilding axiom of developing a mind–muscle connection. Simply
               stated, this strategy involves visualizing the target muscle during the course of a
               lift and willfully directing neural drive to that muscle. When properly executed, the
               approach theoretically allows for increased stimulation of the target muscle while
               reducing the involvement of other synergists.
                   Indirect evidence lends support to a hypertrophic benefit when using an internal
               focus. Numerous studies have found that activation of a given muscle is enhanced
               by using an internal focus of attention. Snyder and Leech (127) demonstrated that
               subjects were able to significantly increase electromyography (EMG) activity in

                the latissimus dorsi by directing their focus to this muscle during the lat pulldown
                exercise. A follow-up study by the same lab showed that the pectoralis major and
                triceps could be individually targeted after subjects were instructed to visualize those
                muscles during performance of the bench press at 50% of 1RM (128). Interestingly,
                the magnitude of the effect was substantially reduced when the load was increased
                to 80% of 1RM. This may be due to increased force demands when training with
                heavier loads, thereby altering the ability to focus on the muscle being worked in
                favor of simply lifting the load. The implication is that the hypertrophy-related benefits
                of using an internal focus may be attenuated or annulled when training with very
                heavy loads. That said, the ability to increase muscle activation through an internal
                focus has been shown in other muscles as well, including the abdominals (20, 35,
                68), gluteus maximus (81), and elbow flexors (86, 137). The findings provide a strong
                rationale for using an internal focus to target a given muscle.
                    The logical question is whether increasing activation of a muscle translates into
                greater muscle growth. Although research on the topic remains limited, some evi-
                dence suggests that this is indeed the case. Wakahara and colleagues (138) carried
                out a two-part experiment to investigate the topic. In the first part of the experiment,
                muscle activation was assessed by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging during
                5 sets of 8 repetitions of the lying triceps extension in 12 untrained men. The results
                showed that activation of the triceps brachii was significantly higher in the proximal
                and middle aspects of the muscle versus the distal portion. In the second part of the
                study, 12 additional subjects performed the same routine used in part 1 of the study
                for 3 days per week over 12 weeks. At the study’s conclusion, increases in muscle
                cross-sectional area corresponded to the specific regions most activated during
                exercise performance. A follow-up study by the same lab reported similar findings
                using alternative exercises for the triceps brachii (139). Although subjects were not
                employing a specific attentional focus, the findings nevertheless indicate that greater
                activation can translate into greater increases in muscle mass.
                    Our lab conducted the only study to date to directly investigate the effects of atten-
                tional focus on muscle hypertrophy (120). Thirty untrained men were randomized to
                perform biceps curls and leg extensions using either an internal focus (i.e., focus on
                the muscle) or an external focus (i.e., focus on the outcome of the lift). Both groups
                performed 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise, with training carried out 3 days
                per week. After 8 weeks, the internal focus group showed significantly greater
                increases in elbow flexor thickness compared to those adopting an external focus
                (12.4% vs. 6.9%, respectively). Alternatively, both groups achieved similar increases
                in quadriceps growth. Although speculative, discrepancies between muscle groups
                may be attributed to the fact that most people find it easier to develop a mind–muscle
                connection in the upper extremities because the arms are used for actions that
                require dexterity and thus more brain-coordinated fine motor control. On the other
                hand, the lower body is used primarily for ambulation, and these gross movement
                patterns require less conscious thought to carry out.
                    In totality, the findings of increased muscle activation combined with those showing
                site-specific hypertrophy in the region of activation seem to suggest that an internal
                attentional focus is the best approach for maximizing muscle development. The only
                study to date that directly investigated the topic provides further support for such an
                approach. Although many gym-derived tenets of bodybuilding are of questionable
                practice, claims of the hypertrophic benefit of developing a mind–muscle connection
                and employing it during exercise performance seem to have merit.

       PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
         HOW TO CALCULATE VOLUME IN MULTI- VERSUS
         SINGLE-JOINT EXERCISES
         Resistance training volume recommendations for hypertrophy are generally based
         on meta-analytic data that endeavor to quantify the number of sets performed per
         muscle group per week (i.e., set volume). However, a conundrum arises when
         deciding how to account for volume during multi-joint versus single-joint exercise.
         In these movements, working muscles can act as agonists (a prime mover in carry-
         ing out the exercise), synergists (a secondary mover that contracts simultaneously
         with the prime mover in performance), or stabilizers that contract isometrically to
         maintain postural stability.
             A recent meta-analysis on the topic gave equal weight to both agonists and syner-
         gists when calculating volume during multi-joint exercise (119). Thus, for determining
         hypertrophy of the triceps brachii, a set of the bench press (multi-joint exercise) and
         triceps pushdown (single-joint exercise) were counted on a 1:1 basis. The same
         principle applied for the biceps brachii during lat pulldowns (multi-joint exercise) and
         arm curls (multi-joint exercise), and the quadriceps during the leg press (multi-joint
         exercise) and leg extension (multi-joint exercise). The approach was justified by find-
         ings of a recent review that concluded the performance of multi-joint and single-joint
         exercises produces similar increases in muscle size (54).
             However, while it is clear that multi-joint exercise can promote significant hyper-
         trophy in the synergists, the extent of their stimulation during these movements
         remains questionable. Muscle activation is influenced by a variety of biomechanical
         factors, including the length–tension relationship, muscle moment arms, and motor
         abundance (i.e., the body’s attempt to determine a unique solution to efficiently
         perform a complex motor task). The interplay of these variables is complex, varying
         between exercises and, to some extent, individuals. However, taking into account
                                                                                       (continued)

              How to Calculate Volume in Multi- Versus Single-Joint Exercises (continued)


               the ability to alter these various biomechanical factors to more favorably work a given
               muscle or segment of a muscle (see the biomechanics section in this chapter for a
               more detailed discussion), it seems logical that single-joint exercise can potentially
               elicit greater hypertrophy for certain muscles compared to multi-joint movements,
               at least in certain exercises and under certain conditions.
                  Numerous electromyographic (EMG) studies report differences in muscle activa-
               tion between multi-joint and single-joint exercise. For example, single-joint exercises
               targeting the hamstrings (e.g., leg curl, stiff-leg deadlift) display significantly greater
               EMG amplitudes than multi-joint lower-body exercise (e.g., squat, leg press) (5, 150).
               With respect to the quadriceps, studies show higher EMG amplitudes for the rectus
               femoris during single-joint knee extension exercise versus multi-joint exercises
               such as the barbell squat and leg press (5, 44). Discrepancies in muscle activation
               between muscles during multi-joint exercises have been shown for the upper-body
               musculature and provide further insights on the topic. Activation of the pectoralis
               major is approximately twice as great as that of the triceps brachii during performance
               of the bench press (27, 108), and EMG amplitude of the biceps brachii is lower than
               that of the latissimus dorsi in the lat pulldown and seated row exercises (79, 82). It
               is important to note that although some evidence indicates a correlation between
               muscle activation and increases in hypertrophy (138-140), causality cannot be inferred
               from correlational data, and the efficacy of EMG in predicting future hypertrophic
               changes remains undetermined.
                  Longitudinal research on the topic remains somewhat equivocal; some studies
               demonstrate a potential superiority of single-joint compared to multi-joint exercise
               (12, 13, 85), and others show no apparent differences (11, 14, 37, 52, 53). Further
               confounding matters, many of the studies measured muscle mass by the circum-
               ference method, which displays limited ability to predict hypertrophic changes. That
               said, the collective body of evidence seems to suggest that single-joint exercises
               provide an added benefit to maximizing muscle growth, as discussed in chapter 4.
               A particular benefit appears relevant to targeting individual heads of a given muscle
               (unpublished findings). It should be pointed out that current research is specific to the
               elbow flexors and extensors; the lack of studies comparing the effects of single-joint
               and multi-joint exercises on lower-body muscle development precludes the ability to
               draw strong inferences about this musculature.
                  As noted in a recent review (121), practitioners are best served by viewing set
               and volume prescription for single- and multi-joint exercises on a 1:1 basis, and then
               using logical rationale and personal expertise to guide exercise program design. When
               customizing exercise prescription, both the biomechanical and physiological aspects
               of an exercise should be taken into account in accordance with applied anatomy of
               the target muscle, consistent with the needs and abilities of the individual.

             PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                IS THERE A BEST TIME OF DAY TO WORK OUT?
                It is well established that biorhythms can influence the performance of daily tasks.
                This holds true for most performance-oriented qualities. From a muscular strength
                standpoint, the time of day at which performance peaks (i.e., the acrophase) appears
                to occur in the evening hours, somewhere around 6 p.m. (58). It therefore has
                been proposed that resistance training should be carried out later in the day to take
                advantage of this phenomenon. Conceivably, higher strength levels should enhance
                mechanical tension during training, translating into greater muscular gains.
                    Some acute data support the concept of training based on the purported strength
                acrophase. For example, Burley and colleagues (23) observed a superior anabolic
                response to evening resistance exercise compared to the same workout performed
                in the morning. However, other research refutes such findings, showing similar
                increases in p70S6K phosphorylation following resistance training bouts performed
                in the morning versus evening hours (122). Importantly, these studies only looked
                at the response to a single bout of exercise, and thus do not take into account how
                adaptations might be affected longitudinally over time.
                    A meta-analysis by Grgic and colleagues (58) sought to determine whether time of
                day affected long-term, exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy. Consistent with com-
                monly held beliefs, results indicated that individuals tend to display greater baseline
                levels of strength in the evening hours compared to the morning. However, analysis
                of findings showed that when training is consistently performed in the morning, these
                differences even out so that strength becomes similar to that during evening training.
                In other words, people adapt to the time of day at which they train, and hence see
                a change in their acrophase. This finding seemingly indicates that time of day is an
                irrelevant consideration from a performance standpoint; over time, mechanical tension
                should not be affected by whether you train in the morning or evening.
                    Consistent with strength outcomes, analysis of hypertrophic changes shows
                similar training-induced increases in muscle size irrespective of whether training is
                carried out early or later in the day. It should be acknowledged that only 5 of the 11
                studies meeting inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis assessed hypertrophy. Thus,
                caution must be used when interpreting these findings because current research is
                insufficient to draw strong conclusions on the topic.
                    Considering the totality of current evidence, it is misguided to blindly train based
                on the concept of an acrophase. Rather, personal preference and convenience should
                dictate when a person chooses to exercise. As a general rule, those who initially do
                not respond well to training at a given time of day will adapt and become similarly
                proficient with consistent adherence to that schedule. That said, it is possible, if not
                likely, that some individuals may not adapt well to a change in workout schedule,
                regardless of how long training is carried out at the alternative time of day. Thus,
                people should be cognizant of their performance and make adjustments accordingly.
                Time of day would be one factor to consider if performance regresses over time.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
 DOES SLEEP AFFECT MUSCLE GROWTH?
 Sleep is a basic human need. It is considered important to human physiology and
 cognition, and thus has relevance to recovery from exercise. Three primary factors
 determine the recuperative outcome of sleep: the duration (total sleep time), qual-
 ity, and phase (circadian timing) of sleep (109). Research indicates that disruptions
 in sleep-related factors can have a negative impact on exercise performance (50).
 However, the impact of sleep on muscle hypertrophy has received less attention.
     A recent review of literature concluded that shiftwork, which tends to disrupt sleep
 patterns, is associated with a negative influence on skeletal muscle health, including
 a decrease in muscle protein synthesis and elevations in proteolysis (2). However,
 these workers also experience alterations in other lifestyle factors such as exposure
 to natural and artificial light, as well as nutritional intake. Decreased sleep quality
 also is a symptom of overtraining syndrome, leading to speculation that dysregulated
 sleep patterns may be a trigger for overtraining (25). But again, multiple other factors
 are purportedly involved in the condition as well (e.g., increased duration of work or
 study; decreased calorie, carbohydrate, and protein intakes; worsened mood states;
 and decreased hydration), thereby confounding the ability to draw strong conclusions
 about the specific role of sleep.
     Several observational studies have shown an association between poor sleep and
 low levels of lean mass (21, 71, 135), although these findings are not universal (101).
 Other observational research indicates that effects of short sleep duration may be
 sex specific, with greater detriments on lean mass in women compared to men.
 Moreover, research shows that a year of melatonin treatment positively affected lean
 mass gains, presumably by helping to regulate sleep patterns (4). Interestingly, evi-
 dence also shows that excessive sleep duration correlates with lower lean mass (70,
 135), suggesting there may be a sweet spot for optimizing muscle growth. However,
 while these studies provide intriguing evidence on the topic, they are correlational
 in nature and thus cannot be used to draw causality.
     Controlled research investigating the effects of sleep deprivation in combination
 with regular resistance training on muscle hypertrophy is scant. An 8-week rodent
 study (93) randomized rats to one of five conditions: (1) control, (2) sleep deprived,
 (3) resistance trained, (4) sham (trained on the apparatus without load), or (5) resist-
 ance trained and sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation consisted of placing animals on
 a platform in a stainless-steel reservoir filled with water up to 1 centimeter (0.4 inch)
 below the surface of the platforms; if an animal fell asleep, it would make contact with
 the water and thus be stirred to wake up. Sleep deprivation was carried out for 96
 continuous hours. Resistance training involved loaded stair climbing with resistance
 progressively increased to continually challenge muscular abilities. Results showed
 that while resistance training attenuated atrophy in sleep-deprived rodents, muscle
 mass only returned to baseline values; the resistance-trained group with normal sleep
 realized substantially greater hypertrophic increases (~10%). Moreover, testosterone
 and IGF-1 levels were blunted, and cortisol levels were elevated in sleep-deprived
 animals compared to those with normal sleep. Although the findings are intriguing, it
 should be noted that the extent of sleep deprivation was severe (96 hours), and thus,
 findings cannot be generalized to predict how restricted sleep (disrupted sleep–wake
 cycle), as commonly seen in human populations, affects hypertrophic adaptations. To
                                                                                (continued)

               Does Sleep Affect Muscle Growth? (continued)

                date, no studies have endeavored to directly examine the effects of restricted sleep
                on exercise-induced changes in muscle growth in humans; thus, it is not possible to
                draw strong inferences on the practical implications of the topic.
                   Overall, current evidence suggests that sleep plays a role in muscle development.
                However, sleep function is complex, involving both qualitative and quantitative
                aspects, and a variety of factors thus must be considered when attempting to draw
                inferences about sleep recommendations to optimize hypertrophy. For example,
                while a compelling body of evidence indicates that sleep deprivation is detrimen-
                tal to exercise performance, the effects of restricted sleep patterns are less clear.
                Thus, potential detriments to hypertrophy resulting from performance impairment
                warrant consideration in this context. Moreover, despite guidelines suggesting that
                humans require 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, anecdotal evidence suggests that
                people can thrive across a fairly wide range of durations, with some needing more
                sleep and others less. Ultimately, requirements are likely individual. The best recom-
                mendation therefore is to gauge sleep needs based on how a person feels during
                training; perceptions of fatigue and lethargy could indicate that sleep-related issues
                are interfering with results.

             •   The application of biomechanical principles to exercise selection is specific to
                 a given muscle, its architecture, and the joint at which it originates. Combining
                 exercises based on applied anatomy and kinesiology is essential to ensuring the
                 complete development of the major musculature.
             •   Hypertrophy-oriented training programs should be periodized to promote con-
                 tinued gains while reducing the risk of overtraining. Several periodized models
                 can be employed to maximize muscle mass, including linear, undulating, and
                 reverse linear approaches. Research has not shown one model to be superior over
                 another, and each can thus be considered a viable strategy in program design.
                 Importantly, periodization is a general concept, not a rigid training system;
                 therefore, the implementation of the models should be adapted based on the
                 needs and abilities of the lifter.
             •   Deload periods that reduce intensity or volume, or both, should be integrated
                 into periodized programs to facilitate rejuvenation and recovery. A 3:1 ratio (in
                 weeks) of training and deloading is a good guideline to use as a starting point.
                 Modifications should then be made depending on individual response.

           PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
               METHODS FOR ASSESSING PROTEIN QUALITY
               Several methods have been developed to determine the quality of protein in a given
               food. These include the protein digestibility–corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS),
               protein efficiency ratio (PER), chemical score (CS), biological value (BV), and net pro-
               tein utilization (NPU). Each method uses its own criteria for assessing protein quality,
               which is ultimately a function of a food’s essential amino acid composition and the
               digestibility and bioavailability of its amino acids (122). For example, the CS method
               analyzes the content of each essential amino acid in a food, which is then divided
               by the content of the same amino acid in egg protein (considered to have a CS of
               100). Somewhat similarly, the PDCAAS method is based on a comparison of the
               EAA content of a test protein with that of a reference EAA profile, but, as the name
               implies, it also takes into account the effects of digestion. The PER method takes
               a completely different approach; it measures weight gain in young rats that are fed
               a test protein as compared to every gram of consumed protein. Alternatively, both
               the BV and NPU methods are based on nitrogen balance: BV measures the nitrogen
               retained in the body and divides it by the total amount of nitrogen absorbed from
               dietary protein, whereas NPU simply compares the amount of protein consumed
               to the amount retained.
                  Given the inherent differences in the protein quality measured, the methods can
               result in large discrepancies in the reported quality of protein-containing foods. Deter-
               mining which single method is the best is difficult, but a case can be made that the
               PDCAAS and BV methods are the most relevant to human growth because they take
               protein digestibility into account. That said, because each method has drawbacks, the
               best approach to assessing protein quality is to take multiple measures—particularly
               PDCAAS and BV—into account.
                  Recently, a new protein scoring system—the digestible indispensable amino acid
               score (DIAAS)—has been advocated as a superior approach to assessing protein
               quality. DIAAS is based on digestibility of protein in the ileum, which is believed
               to provide greater accuracy than current measures (108). Although DIAAS shows
               promise as replacement for PDCAAS and BV, many protein sources have yet to be
               examined using this method (108), thus compromising its practicality.

             PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                HOW MUCH PROTEIN CAN THE BODY USE FOR
                MUSCLE-BUILDING IN A SINGLE MEAL?
                A common claim heard in fitness circles is that the body can absorb only 20 to 30 g
                of protein in a single feeding. This belief is often used in support of eating protein-rich
                meals every few hours throughout the day. However, the veracity of such claims
                are dubious.
                   First and foremost, it is important to differentiate the term absorption from utiliza-
                tion. From a nutritional standpoint, absorption refers to the passage of nutrients from
                the gut into circulation. As such, there is virtually no limit to how much protein a person
                can absorb from a given meal. After digestion, the protein’s constituent amino acids
                traverse the intestinal wall and enter circulation where virtually all become available
                for use at the tissue level. A potential issue occurs when a person ingests individual
                free-form amino acids, which can bring about competition for transport through the
                enterocytes. In this case, amino acids present in the highest concentrations are
                preferentially absorbed at the expense of those in lesser concentrations (49).
                   With this information in mind, the more pertinent question is how much protein the
                body can use from a single feeding to build muscle. This has important implications
                for optimizing muscle development because amino acids not used are either oxidized
                for energy or transaminated to form alternative bodily compounds (94).
                   Research by Areta and colleagues (7) indicates only a limited amount of protein
                can be used at the tissue level. The study randomized subjects to perform 4 sets of
                leg extension exercise and then consume post-exercise protein at rest under the
                following conditions: 8 servings of 10 g every 1.5 hours, 4 servings of 20 g every
                3 hours, or 2 servings of 40 g every 6 hours. Results showed that the 20 g dose
                had the greatest effect on muscle protein synthesis over a 12-hour recovery period,
                suggesting the upper threshold for use is less than 40 g. Although these results may
                seem compelling on the surface, several confounding variables must be considered
                when drawing practical inferences from the data. For one, the researchers used
                whey as the protein source. Whey is a fast-acting protein. Its absorption rate is esti-
                mated to be approximately 10 g per hour (16). This implies that the 40 g dose would
                have been completely absorbed within 4 hours, long before subjects in this group
                consumed their subsequent dose at the 6-hour mark. In contrast, the absorption
                rate for cooked egg protein is approximately 3 g an hour (16), resulting in a much
                more prolonged anabolic effect. Moreover, people most often consume protein
                in the context of whole foods that also contain combinations of carbohydrate and
                fat; the inclusion of these additional nutrients further slows absorption, allowing a
                more time-released entry of the amino acids into circulation. Finally, subjects were
                young males with an average body weight of approximately 82 kg (181 lb); the total
                protein intake of 80 g therefore was far below their daily requirement to maximize
                anabolism (approximately 130 to 180 g). In sum, each of these factors, alone or in
                combination, may have unduly influenced findings and thus limit extrapolation to
                real-world scenarios (126).
                   A subsequent study by Macnaughton and colleagues (84) indicates that the type
                of exercise program also may have been a confounding variable. In this study, sub-
                jects engaged in a total-body resistance training program, as opposed to the study
                by Areta and colleagues (7), which included just leg extension exercise. Immediately
                post-exercise, subjects received either a 20 or 40 g dose of whey protein. In contrast

          to the findings of Areta and colleagues (7), the myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate
          was approximately 20% greater when consuming the 40 g versus 20 g protein dose.
          This suggests that activating a larger amount of muscle mass increases the body’s
          ability to use higher amounts of protein for tissue building.
             More recently, a study in older adults demonstrated a clear dose–response rela-
          tionship between the amount of protein consumed in a single bolus and measures
          of muscle protein synthesis following a bout of total-body resistance exercise (57).
          Protein synthetic rates progressively increased with consumption of 0, 15, 30, and
          45 g, with higher doses showing statistically greater effects than the lower doses.
          Thus, elderly individuals may require an even higher post-workout protein dose to
          achieve a comparable level of anabolism to that of younger individuals.
             Data from intermittent fasting research provides longitudinal evidence that per-
          dose utilization may be even higher than otherwise thought. Tinsley and colleagues
          (138) showed a similar accretion of fat-free mass and skeletal muscle hypertrophy in
          trained women over the course of a supervised 8-week total-body resistance exercise
          program, regardless of whether food was consumed throughout the day or restricted
          to an 8-hour window. Although a mechanistic rationale has yet to be determined for
          the findings, it can be speculated that perhaps the body becomes more efficient at
          using protein for tissue-building purposes when feeding is restricted within limited
          time boundaries, sparing oxidation of amino acids.
             In summary, there is little doubt that a threshold exists for how much protein an
          individual can utilize in a given meal; beyond a certain dose, amino acids will be oxi-
          dized for energy rather than used for muscle building. However, evidence indicates
          that the threshold appears to be higher than the common claim of 20 to 30 g in a
          sitting. It is important to note that several external factors influence the threshold,
          including the protein source, the co-consumption of other nutrients, and the amount
          of muscle involved in the exercise bout. Individual factors such as age, training status,
          and the amount of lean body mass must be considered as well.

             PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
                EATING FREQUENCY FOR HYPERTROPHY
                Given that the anabolic effect of a protein-rich meal lasts 5 to 6 hours (75), it would
                be prudent for people seeking to maximize hypertrophy to spread protein intake of
                0.4 to 0.55 g/kg/meal across at least four meals to reach a minimum of 1.6 to 2.2 g/
                kg/day (126). This frequency pattern ensures that the body remains in anabolism over
                the course of the day and takes full advantage of the >24-hour sensitizing effect of
                resistance training on skeletal muscle (12).

        PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
          NUTRIENT TIMING GUIDELINES
          It is important to consume high-quality protein (at a dose of approximately 0.4 to
          0.5 g/kg of lean body mass) both pre- and post-exercise within about 4 to 6 hours
          of each other depending on meal size. Those who resistance train partially or fully
          fasted should consume protein (at a dose of approximately 0.4 to 0.5 g/kg of lean
          body mass) as quickly as possible post-workout, preferably within 45 minutes of the
          bout. Those who perform 2-a-day workouts (morning and evening bouts in the same
          day) should consume carbohydrate (at a dose of approximately 1.0 to 1.5 g/kg of lean
          body mass) within 1-hour post-workout.

                                           TAKE-HOME POINTS

             •   A positive energy balance is necessary for maximizing the hypertrophic response
                 to resistance training. Those with limited resistance-training experience can ben-
                 efit from a higher energy surplus without incurring significant adipose accretion.
                 Alternatively, well-trained individuals require a smaller surplus (≤500 kcal/day)
                 to prevent unwanted body fat deposition.
             •   Those seeking to maximize hypertrophy should consume at least 1.6 g/kg/day
                 of protein, and perhaps as much as 2.2 g/kg/day. Qualitative factors are not an
                 issue for those eating a meat-based diet. Vegans must be cognizant of eating a
                 variety of protein sources over time so that they get sufficient quantities of the
                 full complement of EAAs.
             •   Carbohydrate intake should be at least 3 g/kg/day to ensure that glycogen stores
                 are fully stocked. Higher carbohydrate intakes may enhance performance and
                 anabolism, but this may be specific to the individual.
             •   Dietary fat should comprise the balance of nutrient intake after setting protein
                 and carbohydrate amounts. People should focus on obtaining a majority of fat
                 from unsaturated sources.
             •   To maximize anabolism, a protein intake of 0.4 to 0.55 g/kg/meal should be
                 spread across a minimum of four meals to reach a total of 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg/day.
             •   Nutrient timing around the exercise bout should be considered in the context
                 of the peri-workout period. It seems prudent to consume high-quality protein
                 (at a dose of approximately 0.4 to 0.5 g/kg of lean body mass) both pre- and
                 post-exercise within about 4 to 6 hours of each other, depending on meal size.
                 Those who train partially or fully fasted should consume protein as quickly as
                 possible post-workout.
